# readme-generator
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, and how to report issues. This application was developed to help users create a high quality Read Me document within just a few minutes.

Description:
The ReadMe-Generator is a command-line application that accepts user input then generates a README.MD file. Initially, a user is prompted for details about the readme like a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions which they can answer in the command line. Then, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. The user is also able to add licensing that the application may be under as well as a link to the users Github repository and email address.

Contributions are accepted.
